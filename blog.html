				<h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-center"><span class="italic font-extrabold">Valuable</span> | The Story So Far</h1>
				<h3 class="text-xl text-center text-gray-600 mt-2">By Josh Bennett</h3>
		
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 text-center">The Gist</h2>
				<p class="mt-4"> <span class="italic font-semibold">Valuable</span> is a life organizing app that goes deeper than any other app or software on the market. The intention at its core is to synthesize <span class="italic">clarity</span> quickly and efficiently. Many of us have had times when:</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
					<li>Everything in life seems muddled and unclear</li>
					<li>We don’t know if our time is being spent wisely whatsoever</li>
					<li>Or uncertainty reigns supreme in the face of not knowing what one is doing with their life</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mt-4">While we can’t claim to be psychologists, we believe that an approach that starts with defining one’s values, core interests, and principles leads the way to more effective planning, projects, and even daily task lists.</p>
				<p class="mt-4">Research shows that, although situational factors may override them, values have been known to predict behavior. And it should not be a surprise that many of us are entirely unfamiliar with our own values. Imagine an unthinking puppet master pulling the strings while we witlessly find ourselves in those situations or evenings where we feel completely stuck. We are seeking to remedy that feeling with a basic tool that will continue to grow as time goes on.</p>
				<p class="mt-4">Instead of telling you a long story about the origin of the idea, let's get into what it will do.</p>
		
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 text-center">The Practicals</h2>
				<p class="mt-4">Notice earlier that I mentioned attaining clarity <span class="italic">quickly</span> and <span class="italic">efficiently</span>. That means that this app can't be over-complicated and cluttered.</p>
				
				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">The Foundation</h3>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
					<li>Values</li>
					<li>Core Interests</li>
					<li>Motivators</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mt-4">Remember the puppet master back there? It's time to meet him or her. It won't be a dense, psychological survey. You'll simply take a moment to read a few definitions of <span class="italic">Values</span>, <span class="italic">Core Interests</span>, and <span class="italic">Motivators</span>. And then you will create a few cards on the screen. Think of cards like widgets that carry a lot of data that will communicate with the other cards and pages.</p>
				<p class="mt-4">You'll have the option to add custom tags to everything. And you'll be prompted that at any point you are free to go to the <span class="italic">Notes</span> tab and write down thoughts or ideas. Those notes can connect to any other element in <span class="italic">Valuable</span>.</p>
				<p class="mt-4">Now with a set foundation, it's time to turn those insights into tangible plans.</p>
		
				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Planning</h3>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
					<li>Goals</li>
					<li>Projects</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mt-4">To sum it up quickly, this phase consists of this: in light of who you are at your core, what you value, what motivates you, and what interests you, what does that lead you to want to accomplish? And what must you do daily to get there? You'll be able to tag each goal, project, or habit with the corresponding element from the <span class="italic">The Foundation</span> phase to see how it all connects.</p>
		
				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Action</h3>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
					<li>Tasks</li>
					<li>Habits</li>
					<li>Notes</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mt-4">Now it's time to embark on the quest that is built into how things already are. You've defined yourself below the mundane day to day, now it's time to return to the mundane with new clarity and vision. This is where you'll return day in and day out, but unlike other apps, everything you do here will be influenced by the previous two phases. Every task and habit must have a tag that corresponds to an element you've already created, and each note will be linkable to any other card.</p>
		
				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 text-center">Organize / Big Picture Overview</h3>
				<p class="mt-4">The final element of <span class="italic">Valuable</span> will be dashboards. On the left-hand side of the window will be the tabs for the previously mentioned phases. On the bottom of the window will be a place where you may create any number of dashboard views to see any number of layouts of data that show your journey. These dashboards will operate through <span class="italic">widgets</span>. They could show your habit tracking, progress on a goal, a project, what you have to do next week, which of your values are being acted on the most, anything really. Of course, there will be templates. It will be completely customizable.</p>
		
				<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 text-center">Wrap Up</h2>
				<p class="mt-4">And that is all for now. We are incredibly excited to be working on this app. The problem we are facing is an existential one, and sometimes those are the problems that drive the deepest into who we are and what we experience at our core. Below this article you will find a form where you can send us any feature requests you may have, and/or sign up for our mailing list to get updates of our progress. <br><br> We'd love your input! <br><br> Thank you for reading, </p>
