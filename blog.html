				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					<em>Valuable</em> is a life organizing app that goes deeper than any other app or software on the market. The intention at its core is to synthesize <em>clarity</em> quickly and efficiently. Many of us have had times when:
				</p>
			</br>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					<li>Everything in life seems muddled and unclear</li>
					<li>We don’t know if our time is being spent wisely whatsoever</li>
					<li>Or uncertainty reigns supreme in the face not knowing what one is doing with their life</li>
				</ul>
			</br>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					While we can’t claim to be psychologists, we believe that an approach that starts with defining one’s values, core interests, and principles leads the way to more effective planning, projects, and even daily task lists.
				</p>
			</br>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					Research shows that, although situational factors may override them, values have been known to predict behavior. And it should not be a surprise that many of us are entirely unfamiliar with our own values. Imagine an unthinking puppet master pulling strings while we witlessly find ourselves in those situations or evenings where we feel completely stuck, feeling like there is no way out. We are seeking to remedy that feeling with a basic tool that will continue to grow as time goes on.
				</p>
			</br>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					Instead of telling you a long story about the origin of the idea, let's get into what it will do.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">The Practicals</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					Notice earlier that I mentioned attaining clarity <em>quickly</em> and <em>efficiently</em>. That means that this app can't be over complicated and cluttered.
				</p>
			</br>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					If you have <em>Valuable</em> on full screen mode, the first thing you would see would be the beginnings of a dashboard and a toolbar on the left hand side. That is where the tabs for pages will go. You'll start with this:
				</p>

				<h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 mb-2">The Foundation</h4>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					<em>Values (the starting point)</em>
				</p>
			</br>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					Remember the puppet master back there? It's time to meet him or her. It won't be a dense, psychological survey. You'll simply take a moment to read a few definitions of <em>Values</em>, and other words like <em>interests</em> and <em>motivators</em>, and then create a few cards on the screen. Think of cards like widgets that carry a lot of data that will communicate with the other cards and pages.
				</p>
			</br>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					You'll have the option to add custom tags to everything. And you'll be prompted that at any point you are free to go to the <em>Notes</em> tab and write down some thoughts or ideas. Those notes can connect to any other element in <em>Valuable</em>.
				</p>
			</br>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					Once you lay the foundation for who you are, what motivates you, and what your core interests are, it's time to move on to the next phase.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Planning</h2>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					<li>Goals</li>
					<li>Projects</li>
					<li>Habits</li>
				</ul>
			</br>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					To sum it up quickly, this phase consists of this: in light of who you are at your core, what you value, what motivates you, and what interests you, what does that lead you to want to accomplish? And what must you do daily to get there? You'll be able to tag each goal, project, or task with the corresponding element from the <em>The Foundation</em> phase to see how it all connects.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Action</h2>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					<li>Tasks</li>
					<li>Notes</li>
				</ul>
			</br>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					Now it's time to embark on the quest that is built into how things already are. You've defined yourself below the mundane day to day, now it's time to return to the mundane day to day with new clarity and vision. This is where you'll return day in and day out, but unlike other apps, everything you do here will be influenced by the previous two phases. Every task must have a tag that corresponds to an element you've already created.
				</p>
			</br>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					You'll be free to create <em>wild card</em> tags to correspond to basic things like grocery shopping, but there will be stats built into the app to show you how many <em>uncategorized</em> tasks you are making on a day-to-day, weekly, and monthly basis.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Organize / Big Picture Overview</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					The final element of <em>Valuable</em> will be dashboards. On the left-hand side of the window will be the tabs for the previously mentioned phases. On the bottom of the window will be a place where you may create any number of dashboard views to see any number of layouts of data that show your journey. These dashboards will operate through <em>widgets</em>. They could show your habit tracking, progress on a goal, a project, what you have to do next week, which of your values are being acted on the most, anything really. Of course, there will be templates. It will be completely customizable.
				</p>

				<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2">Wrap Up</h2>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
					And that is all for now. We are incredibly excited to be working on this app. The problem we are facing is an existential one, and sometimes those are the problems that drive the deepest into who we are and what we experience at our core. Below this article there will be a box where you may email us with any features you would like to see in the app. You will have the option to receive updates about the app's progress.
				</p>
			</br>
				<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
					Thank you for reading.
